# 🏫 Student Performance Evaluation using OOP in Python

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python to evaluate a student's academic performance. It calculates total marks, average score, and assigns grades based on the average.

---

## 📌 Features

- Uses **OOP principles** like encapsulation and method abstraction.
- Accepts student name, ID, and subject-wise marks.
- Calculates:
  - 📊 Total marks
  - 📈 Average marks
  - 🎓 Grade (A/B/C)

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

---

## 🧠 Grading Logic

| Average Marks | Grade |
|---------------|--------|
| > 90          | A      |
| > 75          | B      |
| ≤ 75          | C      |

## 🧾 Example Output

```python
name: Libin 
student id: 12 
marks: {'maths': 98, 'english': 88, 'malayalam': 76} 
average: 87.33 
grade: B
